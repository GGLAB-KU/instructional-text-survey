We extract article and summary pairs in 18 languages from WikiHow, a high quality, collaborative resource of how-to guides on a diverse set of topics written by human authors. We create gold-standard article-summary alignments across languages by aligning the images that are used to describe each how-to step in an article. As a set of baselines for further studies, we evaluate the performance of existing cross-lingual abstractive summarization methods on our dataset. We further propose a method for direct cross-lingual summarization (i.e., without requiring translation at inference time) by leveraging synthetic data and Neural Machine Translation as a pre-training step. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, while being more cost efficient during inference.",

While such hierarchical knowledge is critical for reasoning about complex procedures, most existing work has treated procedures as shallow structures without modeling the parent-child relation. In this work, we attempt to construct an open-domain hierarchical knowledge-base (KB) of procedures based on wikiHow, a website containing more than 110k instructional articles, each documenting the steps to carry out a complex procedure. To this end, we develop a simple and efficient method that links steps (e.g., {``}purchase a camera{''}) in an article to other articles with similar goals (e.g., {``}how to choose a camera{''}), recursively constructing the KB. Our method significantly outperforms several strong baselines according to automatic evaluation, human judgment, and application to downstream tasks such as instructional video retrieval.",

Thus, knowledge about a known process such as {``}buying a car{''} can be used in the context of a new but analogous process such as {``}buying a house{''}. Nevertheless, most event understanding work in NLP is still at the ground level and does not consider abstraction. In this paper, we propose an Analogous Process Structure Induction (APSI) framework, which leverages analogies among processes and conceptualization of sub-event instances to predict the whole sub-event sequence of previously unseen open-domain processes. As our experiments and analysis indicate, APSI supports the generation of meaningful sub-event sequences for unseen processes and can help predict missing events.",

With a new dataset harvested from wikiHow consisting of 772,277 images representing human actions, we show that our task is challenging for state-of-the-art multimodal models. Moreover, the multimodal representation learned from our data can be effectively transferred to other datasets like HowTo100m, increasing the VGSI accuracy by 15 - 20{\%}. Our task will facilitate multimodal reasoning about procedural events.",

This tutorial will provide audience with a systematic introduction of (i) knowledge representations of events, (ii) various methods for automated extraction, conceptualization and prediction of events and their relations, (iii) induction of event processes and properties, and (iv) a wide range of NLU and commonsense understanding tasks that benefit from aforementioned techniques. We will conclude the tutorial by outlining emerging research problems in this area.",

For example, in a text describing fog removal using potatoes, a car window may transition between being foggy, sticky, opaque, and clear. Previous formulations of this task provide the text and entities involved, and ask how those entities change for just a small, pre-defined set of attributes (e.g., location), limiting their fidelity. Our solution is a new task formulation where given just a procedural text as input, the task is to generate a set of state change tuples (entity, attribute, before-state, after-state) for each step, where the entity, attribute, and state values must be predicted from an open vocabulary. Using crowdsourcing, we create OPENPI, a high-quality (91.5{\%} coverage as judged by humans and completely vetted), and large-scale dataset comprising 29,928 state changes over 4,050 sentences from 810 procedural real-world paragraphs from WikiHow.com. A current state-of-the-art generation model on this task achieves 16.1{\%} F1 based on BLEU metric, leaving enough room for novel model architectures.",

    abstract = "Many high-level procedural tasks can be decomposed into sequences of instructions that vary in their order and choice of tools. In the cooking domain, the web offers many, partially-overlapping, text and video recipes (i.e. procedures) that describe how to make the same dish (i.e. high-level task). Aligning instructions for the same dish across different sources can yield descriptive visual explanations that are far richer semantically than conventional textual instructions, providing commonsense insight into how real-world procedures are structured. Learning to align these different instruction sets is challenging because: a) different recipes vary in their order of instructions and use of ingredients; and b) video instructions can be noisy and tend to contain far more information than text instructions. To address these challenges, we use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the same dish. We then use a graph algorithm to derive a joint alignment between multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish. We release the Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus containing {\textasciitilde}150K pairwise alignments between recipes across 4262 dishes with rich commonsense information.",

Half of the questions cannot be answered from the reading texts, but require the use of commonsense and, in particular, script knowledge. We give a thorough analysis of our corpus and show that while the task is not challenging to humans, existing machine comprehension models fail to perform well on the data, even if they make use of a commonsense knowledge base.

For example, given a paragraph about beach erosion, would stormy weather hasten or decelerate erosion? WIQA contains three kinds of questions: perturbations to steps mentioned in the paragraph; external (out-of-paragraph) perturbations requiring commonsense knowledge; and irrelevant (no effect) perturbations. We find that state-of-the-art models achieve 73.8{\%} accuracy, well below the human performance of 96.3{\%}. We analyze the challenges, in particular tracking chains of influences, and present the dataset as an open challenge to the community.",

Existing work has focused either exclusively on entity state tracking (e.g., whether a pan is hot) or on event reasoning (e.g., whether one would burn themselves by touching the pan), while these two tasks are often causally related. We propose CREPE, the first benchmark on causal reasoning of event plausibility and entity states. We show that most language models, including GPT-3, perform close to chance at .35 F1, lagging far behind human at .87 F1. We boost model performance to .59 F1 by creatively representing events as programming languages while prompting language models pretrained on code. By injecting the causal relations between entities and events as intermediate reasoning steps in our representation, we further boost the performance to .67 F1. Our findings indicate not only the challenge that CREPE brings for language models, but also the efficacy of code-like prompting combined with chain-of-thought prompting for multihop event reasoning.",

We propose a fully unsupervised model called SumMC that first generates a guided summary of the contexts conditioning on the mention, and then casts the task to a multiple-choice problem where the model chooses an entity from a list of candidates. In addition to evaluating our model on existing datasets that focus on named entities, we create a new dataset that links noun phrases from WikiHow to Wikidata. We show that our SumMC model achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised performance on our new dataset and on exiting datasets.",

    abstract = "Semantic parsing, the study of translating natural language utterances into machine-executable programs, is a well-established research area and has applications in question answering, instruction following, voice assistants, and code generation. In the last two years, the models used for semantic parsing have changed dramatically with the introduction of neural encoder-decoder methods that allow us to rethink many of the previous assumptions underlying semantic parsing. We aim to inform those already interested in semantic parsing research of these new developments in the field, as well as introduce the topic as an exciting research area to those who are unfamiliar with it. Current approaches for neural semantic parsing share several similarities with neural machine translation, but the key difference between the two fields is that semantic parsing translates natural language into a formal language, while machine translation translates it into a different natural language. The formal language used in semantic parsing allows for constrained decoding, where the model is constrained to only produce outputs that are valid formal statements. We will describe the various approaches researchers have taken to do this. We will also discuss the choice of formal languages used by semantic parsers, and describe why much recent work has chosen to use standard programming languages instead of more linguistically-motivated representations. We will then describe a particularly challenging setting for semantic parsing, where there is additional context or interaction that the parser must take into account when translating natural language to formal language, and give an overview of recent work in this direction. Finally, we will introduce some tools available in AllenNLP for doing semantic parsing research.",

Reporting by a diverse team of NLP researchers from academia and industry with extensive experience in designing, building and using meaning representations, our tutorial has three components: (1) an introduction to common meaning representations, including basic concepts and design challenges; (2) a review of SoTA methods on building models for meaning representations; and (3) an overview of applications of meaning representations in downstream NLP tasks and real-world applications. We will also present qualitative comparisons of common meaning representations and a quantitative study on how their differences impact model performance. Finally, we will share best practices in choosing the right meaning representation for downstream tasks.",

Then we present these dialogue flows to crowd contributors to create conversational utterances. The dataset includes over 4500 annotated conversations with an average of 14 turns that are grounded in over 450 documents from four domains. Compared to the prior document-grounded dialogue datasets, this dataset covers a variety of dialogue scenes in information-seeking conversations. For evaluating the versatility of the dataset, we introduce multiple dialogue modeling tasks and present baseline approaches.",

In this unique setting, the IF can ask clarification questions which may not be grounded in the underlying document and require commonsense knowledge to be answered. The Task2Dial dataset poses new challenges: (1) its human reference texts show more lexical richness and variation than other document-grounded dialogue datasets; (2) generating from this set requires paraphrasing as instructional responses might have been modified from the underlying document; (3) requires commonsense knowledge, since questions might not necessarily be grounded in the document; (4) generating requires planning based on context, as task steps need to be provided in order. The Task2Dial dataset contains dialogues with an average 18.15 number of turns and 19.79 tokens per turn, as compared to 12.94 and 12 respectively in existing datasets. As such, learning from this dataset promises more natural, varied and less template-like system utterances.",

However, customer support interactions in reality often involve agents following multi-step procedures derived from explicitly-defined company policies as well. To study customer service dialogue systems in more realistic settings, we introduce the Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD), a fully-labeled dataset with over 10K human-to-human dialogues containing 55 distinct user intents requiring unique sequences of actions constrained by policies to achieve task success. We propose two additional dialog tasks, Action State Tracking and Cascading Dialogue Success, and establish a series of baselines involving large-scale, pre-trained language models on this dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that while more sophisticated networks outperform simpler models, a considerable gap (50.8{\%} absolute accuracy) still exists to reach human-level performance on ABCD.",

Along with the increase in the number of shared recipes, there have been corresponding increases in recipe-related studies and datasets. However, there are still few datasets that provide linguistic annotations for the recipe-related studies even though such annotations should form the basis of the studies. This paper introduces a novel recipe-related dataset, named Cookpad Parsed Corpus, which contains linguistic annotations for Japanese recipes. We randomly extracted 500 recipes from the largest recipe-related dataset, the Cookpad Recipe Dataset, and annotated 4; 738 sentences in the recipes with morphemes, named entities, and dependency relations. This paper also reports benchmark results on our corpus for Japanese morphological analysis, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. We show that there is still room for improvement in the analyses of recipes.",

In this paper, we show it can be used within a grounded CCG semantic parsing approach that learns a joint model of meaning and context for interpreting and executing natural language instructions, using various types of weak supervision. The joint nature provides crucial benefits by allowing situated cues, such as the set of visible objects, to directly influence learning. It also enables algorithms that learn while executing instructions, for example by trying to replicate human actions. Experiments on a benchmark navigational dataset demonstrate strong performance under differing forms of supervision, including correctly executing 60{\%} more instruction sets relative to the previous state of the art.",

Experiments on four different semantic parsing and code generation tasks show that our system is generalizable, extensible, and effective, registering strong results compared to existing neural semantic parsers.",

The dataset consists of over 300K instructional sentences extracted from WikiHow, which are annotated with commonsense knowledge-based temporal labels indicating implicitly understood information about the actions described by the sentences, including approximately how long an action takes to perform and approximately how long its effects last for. For short duration actions labeled as taking seconds or minutes, which would be of relevance to automated task planning, e.g. in robotics applications, the dataset also provides scalar values to accurately label the temporal durations of how long actions take to perform. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as fine-tuning of large language models are effective in making predictions of commonsense temporal knowledge using the dataset, with up to 80\% accuracy, showing the high utility and promising impact of the constructed resource and its applicability towards generating commonsense temporal knowledge relevant to various},

abstract="Process model extraction (PME) is a recently emerged interdiscipline between natural language processing (NLP) and business process management (BPM), which aims to extract process models from textual descriptions. Previous process extractors heavily depend on manual features and ignore the potential relations between clues of different text granularities. In this paper, we formalize the PME task into the multi-grained text classification problem, and propose a hierarchical neural network to effectively model and extract multi-grained information without manually-defined procedural features. Under this structure, we accordingly propose the coarse-to-fine (grained) learning mechanism, training multi-grained tasks in coarse-to-fine grained order to share the high-level knowledge for the low-level tasks. To evaluate our approach, we construct two multi-grained datasets from two different domains and conduct extensive experiments from different dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance and further investigations demonstrate its effectiveness.",

title = {Understanding natural language commands for robotic navigation and mobile manipulation},
year = {2011},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {This paper describes a new model for understanding natural language commands given to autonomous systems that perform navigation and mobile manipulation in semi-structured environments. Previous approaches have used models with fixed structure to infer the likelihood of a sequence of actions given the environment and the command. In contrast, our framework, called Generalized Grounding Graphs (G3), dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a particular natural language command according to the command's hierarchical and compositional semantic structure. Our system performs inference in the model to successfully find and execute plans corresponding to natural language commands such as "Put the tire pallet on the truck." The model is trained using a corpus of commands collected using crowdsourcing. We pair each command with robot actions and use the corpus to learn the parameters of the model. We evaluate the robot's performance by inferring plans from natural language commands, executing each plan in a realistic robot simulator, and asking users to evaluate the system's performance. We demonstrate that our system can successfully follow many natural language commands from the corpus.},

abstract = {One of the long-term challenges of robotics is to enable robots to interact with humans in the visual world via natural language, as humans are visual animals that communicate through language. Overcoming this challenge requires the ability to perform a wide variety of complex tasks in response to multifarious instructions from humans. In the hope that it might drive progress towards more flexible and powerful human interactions with robots, we propose a dataset of varied and complex robot tasks, described in natural language, in terms of objects visible in a large set of real images. Given an instruction, success requires navigating through a previously-unseen environment to identify an object. This represents a practical challenge, but one that closely reflects one of the core visual problems in robotics. Several state-of-the-art vision-and-language navigation, and referring-expression models are tested to verify the difficulty of this new task, but none of them show promising results because there are many fundamental differences between our task and previous ones. A novel Interactive Navigator-Pointer model is also proposed that provides a strong baseline on the task. The proposed model especially achieves the best performance on the unseen test split, but still leaves substantial room for improvement compared to the human performance.

Existing text-based environments often rely on fictional situations and characters to create a gaming framework and are far from real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ScriptWorld: a text-based environment for teaching agents about real-world daily chores and hence imparting commonsense knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first interactive text-based gaming framework that consists of daily real-world human activities designed using scripts dataset. We provide gaming environments for 10 daily activities and perform a detailed analysis of the proposed environment. We develop RLbased baseline models/agents to play the games in ScriptWorld. To understand the role of language models in such environments, we leverage features obtained from pre-trained language models in the RL agents. Our experiments show that prior knowledge obtained from a pre-trained language model helps to solve real-world text-based gaming environments.},

abstract = {A lot of knowledge about procedures and how-tos are described in text. Recently, extracting semantic relations from the procedural text has been actively explored. Prior work mostly has focused on finding relationships among verb-noun pairs or clustering of extracted pairs. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning individual procedure-specific relationships (e.g. is method of, is alternative of, or is subtask of) among sentences. To identify the relationships, we propose an end-to-end neural network architecture, which can selectively learn important procedure-specific relationships. Using this approach, we could construct a how-to knowledge base from the largest procedure sharing-community, wiki-how.com. The evaluation of our approach shows that it outperforms the existing entity relationship extraction algorithms.},

abstract = {Understanding food recipe requires anticipating the implicit causal effects of cooking actions, such that the recipe can be converted into a graph describing the temporal workflow of the recipe. This is a non-trivial task that involves common-sense reasoning. However, existing efforts rely on hand-crafted features to extract the workflow graph from recipes due to the lack of large-scale labeled datasets. Moreover, they fail to utilize the cooking images, which constitute an important part of food recipes. In this paper, we build MM-ReS, the first large-scale dataset for cooking workflow construction, consisting of 9,850 recipes with human-labeled workflow graphs. Cooking steps are multi-modal, featuring both text instructions and cooking images. We then propose a neural encoder-decoder model that utilizes both visual and textual information to construct the cooking workflow, which achieved over 20\% performance gain over existing hand-crafted baselines.},

As we stand on the verge of an epidemic of diet-linked disorders, it is eminently important to investigate the culinary correlates of recipes to probe their association with sensory responses as well as consequences for nutrition and health.RecipeDB (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb) is a structured compilation of recipes, ingredients and nutrition profiles interlinked with flavor profiles and health associations. The repertoire comprises of meticulous integration of 118 171 recipes from cuisines across the globe (6 continents, 26 geocultural regions and 74 countries), cooked using 268 processes (heat, cook, boil, simmer, bake, etc.), by blending over 20 262 diverse ingredients, which are further linked to their flavor molecules (FlavorDB), nutritional profiles (US Department of Agriculture) and empirical records of disease associations obtained from MEDLINE (DietRx). This resource is aimed at facilitating scientific explorations of the culinary space (recipe, ingredient, cooking processes/techniques, dietary styles, etc.) linked to taste (flavor profile) and health (nutrition and disease associations) attributes seeking for divergent applications.Database URL:  https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb}",

To build the dataset, we instructed the subjects to perform cooking according to instructional texts shown on a display one by one. The instructional texts were generated from flow graphs, which were automatically extracted from recipes sampled from a Web site. The main identity of this dataset is the correspondence between the steps automatically extracted from recipes, and real human activities. Typical uses of our dataset are to construct classifiers for understanding human activities in the kitchen, text generation through observing the activities, and so on.},

One unique feature of recipe data is that it is usually presented in a sequential and multimedia form. However, few publicly available recipe datasets contain multimedia text-image paired data for every cooking step. Our goal is to construct a recipe dataset that contains sufficient multimedia data and the annotations to them for every cooking step, which is important for many research topics, such as cooking flow graph generation, recipe text generation, and cooking action recognition. MIAIS contains 12,000 recipes; each recipe has 9.13 cooking instruction steps on average, each of which is a tuple of a text description and an image. The text descriptions and images are collected from the NII Cookpad Dataset and Cookpad Image Dataset, respectively. We have already released our annotation data and related information.},

abstract = {In food-related services, image information is as important as text information for users. For example, in recipe search services, users find recipes based not only on text but also images. To promote studies on food images, many datasets have recently been published. However, they have the following three limitations: most of the datasets include only thousands of images, they only take account of images after cooking not during the cooking process, and the images are not linked to any recipes. In this study, we construct the Cookpad Image Dataset, a novel collection of food images taken from Cookpad, the largest recipe search service in the world. The dataset includes more than 1.64 million images after cooking, and it is the largest among existing datasets. Additionally, it includes more than 3.10 million images taken during the cooking process. To the best of our knowledge, there are no datasets that include such images. Furthermore, the dataset is designed to link to an existing recipe corpus and thus, a variety of recipe texts, such as the title, description, ingredients, and process, is available for each image. In this paper, we described our dataset's features in detail and compared it with existing datasets.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, particularly the development of large-scale language models that are pretrained on vast amounts of knowledge, are creating novel opportunities within the realm of Knowledge Engineering. In this paper, we investigate the usage of large language models (LLMs) in both zero-shot and in-context learning settings to tackle the problem of extracting procedures from unstructured PDF text in an incremental question-answering fashion. In particular, we leverage the current state-of-the-art GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) model, accompanied by two variations of in-context learning that involve an ontology with definitions of procedures and steps and a limited number of samples of few-shot learning. The findings highlight both the promise of this approach and the value of the in-context learning customisations. These modifications have the potential to significantly address the challenge of obtaining sufficient training data, a hurdle often encountered in deep learning-based Natural Language Processing techniques for procedure extraction.},

abstract="Process extraction from text is an important task of process discovery, for which various approaches have been developed in recent years. However, differently from other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions carefully annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. This paper presents the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text. The PET dataset, annotation guidelines, and inception schema are freely available via huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET.",

    abstract = "When humans perform a particular task, they do so hierarchically: splitting higher-level tasks into smaller sub-tasks. However, most works on natural language (NL) command of situated agents have treated the procedures to be executed as flat sequences of simple actions, or any hierarchies of procedures have been shallow at best. In this paper, we propose a formalism of procedures as programs, a method for representing hierarchical procedural knowledge for agent command and control aimed at enabling easy application to various scenarios. We further propose a modeling paradigm of hierarchical modular networks, which consist of a planner and reactors that convert NL intents to predictions of executable programs and probe the environment for information necessary to complete the program execution. We instantiate this framework on the IQA and ALFRED datasets for NL instruction following. Our model outperforms reactive baselines by a large margin on both datasets. We also demonstrate that our framework is more data-efficient, and that it allows for fast iterative development.",

abstract = {Text presented in augmented reality provides in-situ, real-time information for users. However, this content can be challenging to apprehend quickly when engaging in cognitively demanding AR tasks, especially when it is presented on a head-mounted display. We propose ARTiST, an automatic text simplification system that uses a few-shot prompt and GPT-3 models to specifically optimize the text length and semantic content for augmented reality. Developed out of a formative study that included seven users and three experts, our system combines a customized error calibration model with a few-shot prompt to integrate the syntactic, lexical, elaborative, and content simplification techniques, and generate simplified AR text for head-worn displays. Results from a 16-user empirical study showed that ARTiST&nbsp;lightens the cognitive load and improves performance significantly over both unmodified text and text modified via traditional methods. Our work constitutes a step towards automating the optimization of batch text data for readability and performance in augmented reality.},

abstract = {With the growing interests in semantic web services and context-aware computing, the importance of ontologies, which enable us to perform context-aware reasoning, has been accepted widely. While domain-specific and general-purpose ontologies have been developed, few attempts have been made for a situation ontology that can be employed directly to support activity-oriented context-aware services. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically constructing a large-scale situation ontology by mining large-scale web resources, eHow and wikiHow, which contain an enormous amount of how-to instructions (e.g., ''How to install a car amplifier''). The construction process is guided by a situation model derived from the procedural knowledge available in the web resources. Two major steps involved are: (1) action mining that extracts pairs of a verb and its ingredient (i.e., objects, location, and time) from individual instructional steps (e.g., ) and forms goal-oriented situation cases using the results and (2) normalization and integration of situation cases to form the situation ontology. For validation, we measure accuracy of the action mining method and show how our situation ontology compares in terms of coverage with existing large-scale ontology-like resources constructed manually. Furthermore, we show how it can be utilized for two applications: service recommendation and service composition.},
